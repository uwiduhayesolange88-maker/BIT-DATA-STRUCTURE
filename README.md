This Python program simulates a Retail Discount Calculator by using integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries.
It computes totals, averages, and thresholds, manages item lists and arrays, and updates/deletes records in dictionaries.
The project demonstrates data handling, condition checks, and formatted reporting in a retail context.
